Project Overview

Crime in South Africa is a pressing social and economic challenge. High levels of violent and property-related crimes impact public safety, business confidence, and urban development. This project integrates data analysis, machine learning, time series forecasting, and drone simulation to provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policy makers.

The project includes:

Classification of Crime Hotspots using a multi-relational dataset.

Forecasting Crime Trends with Prophet for selected crime categories.

Interactive Streamlit Dashboard (app.py) to visualize analysis, results, and forecasts.

Drone Programming Simulation to demonstrate monitoring of identified hotspots.




Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics, trends, and visualizations.

Crime Hotspot Classification

Visualize confidence intervals and practical implications.

Drone Simulation

Grid-based 3D frame representation of the city.

Hotspots marked as Points of Interest (POIs).

Path planning simulation for drone patrol.

Interactive Dashboard

Filter by category, location, and time period.
